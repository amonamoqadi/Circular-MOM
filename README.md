# Circular-MOM

Circular MOM is my second graduation project (Hardware).

it based on building two bracelets that can be charged, one for the mother and the other for the child. There will be a connection Bluetooth between the two bracelets.  When the child moves away from the mother by a certain distance, which means a disconnection Bluetooth happened, the mother’s bracelet will start to vibrate and the child’sbracelet will start making a sound and then send a message containing a warning text to the mother’s phone.  In addition, a mobile application is provided to let the  mother  track  her  child's  location.

There are two files, one called master and the other is slave, master file contains the code used in child's bracelet and slave file contains the code used for mother's bracelet.
 Arduino IDE was used to uploud the code to controller.
